description: This is my attempt to reverse engineer an animation originally
  created by Etienne Jacob (<https://bleuje.github.io/>). It utilizes what
  Etienne calls "the replacement method", where one geometry instance seamlessly
  replaces another to create a perfectly repeating loop. I'll definitely be
  practicing this technique in the near future.
