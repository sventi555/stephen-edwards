title: Ant Mill
description: '"An ant mill is an observed phenomenon in which a group of army
  ants are separated from the main foraging party, lose the pheromone track and
  begin to follow one another, forming a continuously rotating circle, commonly
  known as a "death spiral" because the ants might eventually die of
  exhaustion." -Wikipedia'
