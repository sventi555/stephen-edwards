title: Hitomezashi Stitch
description: >-
  This sketch was inspired by the Hitomezashi stitching pattern, which I learned
  about from this Numberphile video
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfhzlMk2eY>.



  Imagine that you are sewing along a grid, and you can start each row with either a stitch on top, or underneath the fabric. By varying how you start each row and column, you get varying patterns similar to the one seen in this sketch. Refresh the page if you want to see different patterns! 



  Fun fact: all Hitomezashi stitching patterns are [2-colourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring).



  Enjoy!
