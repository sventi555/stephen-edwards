title: Recursive Sliding Puzzle
description: This is yet another attempt to reverse engineer an animation
  originally created by Etienne Jacob (<https://bleuje.github.io/>). You may be
  familiar with [sliding puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle),
  where you slide tiles around to reach some predetermined end state. Now,
  imagine if each tile was itself a sliding puzzle. This animation depicts that
  scenario. Enjoy.
